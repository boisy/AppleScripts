# Script Debugger Scripts
Scripts for use when working in [Script Debugger](https://latenightsw.com/).

- [Open Used Script Libraries](./Open%20Used%20Script%20Libraries.applescript)
    - Open the script libraries that are currently in use in the front script.
- [Save For GitHub](./Save%20For%20GitHub.applescript)
    - This duplicates the front script in its current file location as a .applescript file with unix style line endings so it is readable on GitHub.
