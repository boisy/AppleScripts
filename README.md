# My AppleScripts

Collection of AppleScripts I've developed over the years for many purposes. Some are great as standalone scripts while others are great for incorporation with others.

> This repo is in continuous development and will be updated as scripts are developed (and as I have time).

## About

These apps are mostly launched via [Keyboard Maestro][kmapp], [Alfred][alfredapp], [BetterTouchTool][bttapp], [Hazel][hazelapp].

Many of these apps depend on this [script library][kevinslib] I developed, so if you see this at the top of the script, make sure you get that library.

```AppleScript
use kl : script "Kevin's Library"
```

## Contents

I've divided the scripts into an applications section (scripts specific to an app) and a Global section where they can be used anywhere. Clicking the name of the script will show you the script directly, but **make sure to view the README for each section** by clicking the title of the section.

## Tools

- [Script Debugger](https://latenightsw.com/) - By far the most valuable scripting tool. When I first started learning scripting with Script Editor, the process was slow and frustrating. With Script Debugger I learned 100 times faster and understood everything much easier.
- [UI Browser](https://pfiddlesoft.com/uibrowser/) - Invaluable tool for UI scripting. UI scripting is brutal on its own, and slightly less brutal with the Accessibility Inspector, but UI Browser makes it so much simpler, I tried it once and knew I had to get it.
- [JSON Helper](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/json-helper-for-applescript/id453114608?mt=12) - Makes working with JSON so much simpler, incredibly useful and free!
- [Location Helper](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/location-helper/id488536386?mt=12) - Find your geo code location in a snap, and for free!
- [Atom](https://atom.io/) plugins
  - [atom-applescript](https://github.com/franzheidl/atom-applescript) - adds language support to Atom so you can view AppleScript syntax
  - [build-osa](https://github.com/idleberg/atom-build-osa) - Lets you build and execute AppleScripts from Atom.

## Tips

### Keep Scripts In Sync Using Aliases

In order for scripts to be accessible via the Script Menu, scripts must be stored in `~/Library/Scripts`, but if you like to keep your scripts synced between devices, this location is a pain. I used to have a [Hazel][hazelapp] rule set up to sync `~/Library/Scripts` to Dropbox that worked fine for years, but I didn't like all the extra processing needed to sync and worse yet I had 2 copies of every script which was messy and got confusing.<br>
I realized later that moving all my scripts to `~/Dropbox/Library/Scripts` then creating an alias to that location and moving it `~/Library/Scripts` allows for my scripts to be stored in Dropbox, and still be accessible in the Script Menu! This method works exactly as well with the `~/Library/Script Libraries` folder. Here's a screenshot of what it looks like in Finder.

![aliasDemo](./imgs/aliasPath.png)

#### How to do it:

1.  **Make a backup** of the folder your moving to your Desktop just in case you mess up.
2.  I recommend having the same folder structure in Dropbox so make the folder `~/Dropbox/Library/`
3.  Copy the folder you want to sync (`~/Library/Scripts/`, `~/Library/Script Libraries/`) and paste into the `~/Dropbox/Library/` folder you made.
4.  Delete the original folder you copied from `~/Library/`
5.  Select the folder you pasted into `~/Dropbox/Library/` then click `File > Make Alias`
6.  Move the resulting alias back to `~/Library/`. The result will be like `~/Library/Scripts alias` so rename the alias by removing the "alias" part so it looks like `~/Library/Scripts` and you're good to go!

- **NOTE**: Symlinks don't work for this method, I originally tried the following command which did make an alias, but then the scripts weren't accessible via the Script Menu.


    ln -s ~/Library/Scripts ~/Dropbox/Library/Scripts/
