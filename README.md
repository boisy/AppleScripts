# My AppleScripts

Collection of AppleScripts I've developed or acquired over the years for many purposes. Some are great as standalone scripts while others are great for incorporation with others.

> This repo is in continuous development and will be updated as scripts are developed (and as I have time).

## About

This repo was created for two main reasons.
1. Provide others with useful scripts for automating their workflow on macOS.
2. As a tool for AppleScript education by providing example scripts, tools, tips and AppleScript resources.

With some exceptions, almost all these scripts are executable by themselves via the Script Menu. However, I generally turn to third party automation apps to execute them, including [Keyboard Maestro][kmapp], [Alfred][alfredapp], [BetterTouchTool][bttapp] and [Hazel][hazelapp].

- **Notes on formatting**
For those who are unaware, the standard file format for AppleScripts is `.scpt` or `.scptd`, but these file types are not readable on GitHub, so for readability's sake, all these scripts have been exported as a .applescript file (which is just a text file). So if you were wondering about the file type, this is the reason.

- Many of these scripts depend on this [script library][kevinslib] I developed, so if you see the following line at the top of the script, make sure you get that library and place it into `~/Library/Script Libraries` otherwise the script is non-functional.

```AppleScript
use kl : script "Kevin's Library"
```

## Contents

I've divided the scripts into 3 sections:
1. **Application Scripts** - Scripts designed for use in a specific application.
2. **Global Scripts** - Scripts that are meant to be executed in any application.
    - _NOTE_: There are scripts here that are specific to an application but are meant to executed globally, so the scripts in the Application Scripts section with the globe icon [ ðŸŒŽ ] next to them imply global scope for that specific application.
3. **Scripts for Script Development** - These scripts are useful handlers that can be copied into scripts or into a script library that makes scripting much simpler.

Clicking the name of the script will show you the script directly, but **make sure to view the README for each section** by clicking the title of the section to see instructions/explanations/demos.

### Scripts for Script Development
- [coming soon]

* * *

## Tools

- **[Script Debugger](https://latenightsw.com/)** - By far the most valuable scripting tool. When I first started learning scripting with Script Editor, the process was slow and frustrating. With Script Debugger I learned 100 times faster and understood everything much easier.
- **[UI Browser](https://pfiddlesoft.com/uibrowser/)** - Invaluable tool for UI scripting. UI scripting is brutal on its own, and slightly less brutal with the Accessibility Inspector, but UI Browser makes it so much simpler, I tried it once and knew I had to get it.
- **[JSON Helper](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/json-helper-for-applescript/id453114608?mt=12)** - Makes working with JSON so much simpler, incredibly useful and **free**!
- **[Location Helper](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/location-helper/id488536386?mt=12)** - Find your geo code location in a snap, and for **free**!
- **[Dash](https://kapeli.com/dash)** - Fantastic tool for API browsing, after installation go to `Preferences > Downloads` and install the AppleScript docset to have blazing fast access to AppleScript documentation, plus its **free**!
- **[Atom Packages](https://atom.io/packages)** (I do all my script writing in Script Debugger but most of my Markdown stuff in [Atom](https://atom.io/) so these are very useful.)
  - [atom-applescript](https://github.com/franzheidl/atom-applescript) - adds language support to Atom so you can view AppleScript syntax
  - [build-osa](https://github.com/idleberg/atom-build-osa) - Lets you build and execute AppleScripts from Atom.

## Tips

### Keep Scripts In Sync Using Aliases

In order for scripts to be accessible via the Script Menu, scripts must be stored in `~/Library/Scripts`, but if you like to keep your scripts synced between devices, this location is a pain. I used to have a [Hazel][hazelapp] rule set up to sync `~/Library/Scripts` to Dropbox that worked fine for years, but I didn't like all the extra processing needed to sync and worse yet I had 2 copies of every script which was messy and got confusing.


I realized later that moving all my scripts to `~/Dropbox/Library/Scripts` then creating an alias to that location and moving it `~/Library` allows for my scripts to be stored in Dropbox, and still be accessible in the Script Menu!
> This method works exactly as well with the `~/Library/Script Libraries` folder.

Here's a screenshot of what it looks like in Finder.

![aliasDemo](./imgs/aliasPath.png)

**How to do it:**

1.  **Make a backup** of the folder your moving to your Desktop just in case you mess up.
2.  I recommend having the same folder structure in Dropbox so make the folder `~/Dropbox/Library/`
3.  Copy the folder you want to sync (`~/Library/Scripts/` or `~/Library/Script Libraries/`) and paste into the `~/Dropbox/Library/` folder you made.
4.  Delete the original folder you copied from `~/Library/`
5.  Select the folder you pasted into `~/Dropbox/Library/` then click `File > Make Alias`
6.  Move the resulting alias back to `~/Library/`. The result will be like `~/Library/Scripts alias` so rename the alias by removing the " alias" part so it looks like `~/Library/Scripts` and you're good to go!

- **NOTE**: Symlinks don't work for this method, I originally tried the following command which did make an alias, but then the scripts weren't accessible via the Script Menu.

    ```shell
    ln -s ~/Library/Scripts ~/Dropbox/Library/Scripts/
    ```

## Resources
- [AppleScript Language Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/AppleScript/Conceptual/AppleScriptLangGuide/introduction/ASLR_intro.html) - Necessary for efficient script development, explains everything about how to script with AppleScript. (I highly recommend the [Dash](https://kapeli.com/dash) version though, much faster and easier to use)
- [Macscripter.net](https://macscripter.net/) - Forum for AppleScripters to post examples and ask questions. Definitely create a free account.
