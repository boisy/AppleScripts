Scripts for working with Mail.

## Contents

- [Set Color of Text](./Set-Color-of-Text.applescript)
  - {++Insert Explanation Here++}
- [Make Mail URL](./Make-Mail-URL.applescript)
- [Mark All Inbox Messages as Read](./Mark-All-Inbox-Messages-as-Read.applescript)
- [Show Message][9c348c76]
    - This script is used in conjunction with Mail rules to open and show an email
    message. Particularly useful for messages that are important that you don't
    want to miss.
    - My main rule that uses this is my VIP rule (screenshot below):
    ![viprule](../imgs/mail-rule-vip.png)

    - _NOTE_: For a rule script to work it must be placed in: `~/Library/Application Scripts/com.apple.mail`


[9c348c76]: ./Show-Message.applescript
