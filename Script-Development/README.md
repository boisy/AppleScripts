# Scripts for Script Development

These scripts are generally to make development of scripts easier. They can be copied into an existing script or incorporated into a Script Library for consistent use, which is what I did with a lot these in my [script library](https://github.com/kevin-funderburg/AppleScript-libraries/blob/master/Kevin's%20Library.applescript).
